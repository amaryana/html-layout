      <p>SVN uses a single central repository to serve as the communication hub for developers, and collaboration takes place by passing changesets between the developers’ working copies and the central repository. This is different from Git’s collaboration model, which gives every developer their own copy of the repository, complete with its own local history and branch structure. Users typically need to share a series of commits rather than a single changeset. Instead of committing a changeset from a working copy to the central repository, Git lets you share entire branches between repositories.

The commands presented below let you manage connections with other repositories, publish local history by “pushing” branches to other repositories, and see what others have contributed by “pulling” branches into your local repository.</p>
